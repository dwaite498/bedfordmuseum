# Bedford Museum and Geneological Library

This is a rebuild of the Bedford Museum website. An initial straight html and css code base will be replaced with a rails app as the project progresses into the bookstore and member services sections. The goal is to add responsive aspects to the website with AJAX and JQuery. Future items are planned are listed below

 - Staff profiles and contact information for each
 - fully integrated bookstore and giftshop with rotating slideshow in main index page of selection of new or promoted books.
 - calendar of events/blog interface to increase user interaction and communication between ownership and users.
 - fully protected and administrator managed member section that allows controlled acces to more sensitive aspects of the museum collections.
 - content management system for user friendly website maintenance and administration.
 - additional resoures, history, and regional information that has been outside the scope of the Museums resources up to now.
 - audio/visual integration for historical records and museum event recordings.

 Additional items are anticipated but not necessarily going to be included in the current contract
 - Forum/Message board for family genealogy
 - Photo galleries for photos
 - Visual exhibits
