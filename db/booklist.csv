Liberty Falling,"Liberty Falling is a fictional, but accurate account of a true mountain family of the Civil War era surviving on the western slopes of Sharptop Mountain. A tragic accident leaves the father unable to provide for the family, forcing his three young sons to assume all household responsibilities. When the Union Army pours over the Peaks of Otter on their campaign to take Lynchburg, the boys become separated from their home. The two eldest set out on a trek for help from the Confederate Army rumored to be in Lynchburg. Their journey carries them through the many sights of the county and city, and ultimately leads them to a timely meeting with the army's commanders. Being granted return passage home, the brothers get caught up in a brutal cavalry skirmish as General Hunter's army approaches. The tragedies and unforeseen revelations that follow cause their trip to come full circle through the devastated town of Liberty and back to the concerned family and community that so anxiously been waiting",G.L.

Indian Island,"The story of Virginia's Monacan tribe is one of American Indian's lost cultures, recently rediscovered. Once a flourishing Siouan confederacy, thriving in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, These forgotten people plunged into a cultural disarray before their history was accurately recorded. The state of Virginia, over the past century, officially ignored their existence, and that denial-of -existence created further social confusion among them. A study of these brave people emerges as a metaphor of similar plights among other Blue Ridge kinsmen to reclaim their heritage. This book will explain how a brave, determined people, whose history was on the brink of extinction, sprang from the ashes of cultural obscurity.",Peter W. Houck and Mintcy D.

Bockman has been researching his family since 1988 and writing and lecturing about family history since 1996. He is grateful that many of his ancestors had their picture taken and that others had the foresight to write the person's name on the back and hand them down to future generations along with numerous important papers. His inheritance was a collection of interesting ancestors, numerous photographs, a variety of unique record, and a few family stories.

The Early Life of Booker T. Washington,"A century after his death, Dr. Booker T. Washington's legacy lives on in the educational institution established for the instruction and uplift of African-American students, Tuskegee University, and in the expansion of educational opportunities throughout the South. Yet, historical scholarship has yielded little knowledge on the origins of Prof. Washington. Various aspects of his birth and life in bondage on a tobacco plantation in remote piedmont Virginia has remained largely a mystery until now. This recent work illuminates Booker T. Washington's birth and early life based entirely on new research and will promote further scholarship into the dynamic of the Sage of Tuskegee.",John H. Whitfield,1,6.98,2,
